# Odai's Apartment Booking Website

## Project Goal

Build a personal website to list and rent my short-term rental apartments. The goal is to avoid commissions from Airbnb and Booking.com by allowing guests to book directly through my own website.

I currently manage 2 apartments and may add 2 more in the future.

## Website Pages

The website will include the following pages:

- **Homepage**
- **Apartments List**
- **Apartment Details Page**
- **Booking Page**
- **Booking Confirmation Page**
- **Contact Page**
- **Admin Dashboard (Private)**
